# Identify Topological Material with Machine Learning
 
Topological materials exhibit unique physics stemmed from the nontrivial topology
in the electron bands, with potential applications for novel circuits. Topological
database now contain tens of thousands of materials, screened by first principle
and symmetry-based calculations. Here I attempt to train a classifier on database
"Materiae" that predicts whether a material is topologically trivial or non-trivial
given its crystalline info. Trained linear classifier and feedforward neural network
gives 85% and 87% testing accuracy. Results of different optimizers and hyper
parameter sets are discussed. Attempt via automatic machine learning function of
H2O gives instead 91% test accuracy, and indicates that gradient boosting machine
is better model.
